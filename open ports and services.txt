potential security risks
Port	Risk Description
1	Rarely used, but if open could be abused to enumerate services or act as an entry point
53	DNS service misconfiguration can lead to DNS poisoning or amplification attacks
80	Unencrypted web interface; vulnerable to sniffing and MITM attacks
443	If improperly configured, could be vulnerable to SSL/TLS exploits
49152	UPnP can allow internal devices to be exposed externally if misconfigured, risk of remote attacks
135	MSRPC has been exploited in the past for remote code execution (e.g., Blaster worm)
139	NetBIOS leaks system info, can be used for lateral movement or SMB exploits
445	SMB is a common ransomware attack vector; unpatched services can be exploited
7070	Streaming server vulnerabilities if outdated
